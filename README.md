# ICL - 1010 Digital Graphics (JS Canvas)

**This is the beginning of my journey into Java Script and Programming, this is a record of my Graphics assignments as part of my APPLIED DATA SCIENCE DEGREE APPRENTICESHIP BSC (HONS). Feel free to take a look and use the files, more than happy to share and help people on their own journey.**

### Assignment One ###
*Part 1: Design a web page.*
 - Using the scenario above you are to design and create a small selection of mock up designs (image quality is not important here, but placement is). Indicate which design you will follow and give reasons for your decision.

*Part 2: Create the web page using HTML, JavaScript and Canvas.*
 - Using your chosen design, create the single Welsh Heritage web page using HTML, (CSS is optional) JavaScript and the Canvas API. You should aim to use a range of Canvas elements.

*Part 3: Justify your final design.*
 - Using your final website compared to your initial design, justify your choices.

**Scenario - Welsh Heritage Sites**

You have been tasked as a consultant to design a graphically rich web page to promote Welsh heritage. You will only design and create the main landing page. The page title will be simply ‘Welsh Heritage’ and this should be clear on the page. The layout and amount on written content is up to you, but at this stage of design, filler text maybe used (Lorem Ipsum for example). The placement, range and use of images however, is all important. You should aim to show off several elements of drawing and image manipulation, not just loading images.
